## Movitation

Our motivation stems from the urgent need to comprehensively examine and address homelessness in California. By harnessing the power of data science and leveraging the rich information within HDIS, our project aspires to contribute valuable insights that can inform evidence-based policies and interventions by analyzing the demographic composition of all register homeless people in California and what types of hospital would homeless people more likely to visit.  



## Related Work

We are inspired to do this because homelessness has been a long term problem in the United States, which negatively affects cityscape and poses threats to residentsâ€™ life and property. Additionally, California has the largest homeless population in the nation. Learning statistical analysis tools from this class, we are motivated to investigate the homelessness situation in California and what are some factors that influence homelessness. 



## Initial Questions

The initial questions centered around understanding the sociodemographic attributes of homeless individuals in California and identifying predictors for the frequency of encounters with homeless patients.

As our research progressed, we refined our questions to achieve greater specificity. This refinement was driven by a deeper familiarity with our datasets and a desire to focus on more explicit aspects of the research.

The current research questions are:

* How is the number of homeless people vary by demographic variables including age, gender, race and type of payer?
* Has the number of homeless people by demographics changed over the year?
* Are encounter type, ownership of the hospital, number of hospital beds significant predictors for the number of homeless patient encounters?
* How well is our model at predicting the number of homeless people?


## Data Source

In this project, we used two datasets to address our research question. One dataset features demographic characteristics of homeless people who are receiving homelessness response services and number of them over the year. Another dataset features characteristics of hospital encounters of homeless people and information about which type of hospital they visits.

We used [data](https://healthdata.gov/State/Hospital-Encounters-for-Homeless-Patients/6ew5-yd9m) from Homelessness Data Integration System (HDIS) that include homeless patients information in all 44 Continuums of Care (CoC) in California. This dataset includes characteristics of hospital encounters of homeless people and information about which type of hospital they visits among all CoC registries in California from 2019 to 2020. 

We also used another [dataset](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/homelessness-demographics) from California Open Data Portal. This dataset contains demographic variables including age, race, ethnicity, and gender among from people who are receiving homeless response services in Homelessness Data Integration System. Since this data is from 2017 to 2023, we can conduct number of homeless people estimate by year. This data could also complement the previous dataset to have a more recent estimate. 

## Exploratory Analysis\
### Part1: datasets "People Receiving Homeless Response Services"

#### Description of datasets

![](image/datasource.png)

The `demo` datasets are defined as "People Receiving Homeless Response Services by Age, Race, Ethnicity, and Gender".

This data set gives annual statistics by age group, race, ethnicity, and gender on the number of people who have benefited from homelessness assistance services.

The Homelessness Data Integration System (HDIS), an extensive data repository that compiles and examines information from each of California's 44 Continuums of Care (CoC), is the source of this information. Every Community of Communities (CoC) collects and disseminates information on the people it serves via a range of programs, such as those aimed at ending homelessness, offering outreach services to the homeless, assisting with permanent housing solutions, and other projects in line with California's Housing First objectives.

-   Important Variables:

`CALENDAR_YEAR`: Calendar Year\
`LOCATION`: Location\
`ETHNICITY`: Ethnicity\
`AGE_GROUP_PUBLIC`: Age Group\
`GENDER`: Gender\
`RACE`: Race\
`EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS`: Number of people receiving homelessness services

#### Data Process

First, we converted all the variable names to lowercase.

Then we removed the unneeded variable "location_id", and removed the null value of "experiencing_homelessness".

Finally, we batch export and import the four cleaned csv files into datasets.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# import data
library(tidyverse)
age_demo = read.csv("./original data/demo/age_demo.csv")
ethnicity_demo = read.csv("./original data/demo/ethnicity_demo.csv")
gender_demo = read.csv("./original data/demo/gender_demo.csv")
race_demo = read.csv("./original data/demo/race_demo.csv")
```

```{r}
# Clean data
library(readr)
folder_path <- "./original data/demo/"
csv_files <- list.files(folder_path, pattern = ".csv")

# define a function to process a CSV file
clean_csv <- function(input_file, output_file) {
  data <- read.csv(input_file)
  data_cleaned <- data |> 
    filter(EXPERIENCING_HOMELESSNESS != "*") |>
    dplyr::select(-LOCATION_ID) |>
    janitor::clean_names() 
   write.csv(data_cleaned, file = output_file, row.names = FALSE)
   #return(data_cleaned)
}

output_folder <- "./processed data/demo/"

# process CSV files using the lapply function
cleaned_data_list <- lapply(csv_files, function(file) {
  input_file <- paste0(folder_path, file)
  output_file <- paste0(output_folder, "cleaned_", file)
  clean_csv(input_file, output_file)
})

# import clean data
age_clean = read.csv("./processed data/demo/cleaned_age_demo.csv")
ethnicity_clean = read.csv("./processed data/demo/cleaned_ethnicity_demo.csv")
gender_clean = read.csv("./processed data/demo/cleaned_gender_demo.csv")
race_clean = read.csv("./processed data/demo/cleaned_race_demo.csv")
```

#### Summary

To begin with the analyzing process, we first summarize the counts and percentages of Californian homeless people from 2017 to 2023, stratified by age, ethnicity, gender, race, separately for each of the four datasets:

Dataset categorized by age:

```{r}
age_clean_for_summary = 
  age_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location)

age_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(age_group_public) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()
```

Dataset categorized by ethnicity:

```{r}
ethnicity_clean_for_summary = 
  ethnicity_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location)

ethnicity_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(calendar_year) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()

ethnicity_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(ethnicity) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()
```

Dataset categorized by gender:

```{r}
gender_clean_for_summary = 
  gender_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location)

gender_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(calendar_year) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()

gender_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(gender) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()
```

Dataset categorized by race:

```{r}
race_clean_for_summary = 
  race_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location)

race_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(calendar_year) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()

race_clean_for_summary |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100) |> knitr::kable()
```


#### Data visualization

The data visualization serves as a foundation for a more in-depth investigation by providing us with a preliminary understanding of the relationship between the variables (age, gender, ethnicity, and race) and the number of homeless people and how that relationship has evolved over time.

##### Total Homelessness by Year and Age
```{r,message=FALSE}
# line plot for "Total Number of Homeless People by Year and Age Group from 2017 to 2023"
library(plotly)
age_plot <- age_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location) |>
  group_by(calendar_year,age_group_public) |>
  summarise(total_homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness))

age_plot |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Year: ", calendar_year, "\nAge Group: ", age_group_public)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~calendar_year, y = ~total_homelessness, type = "scatter", mode = "line", color = ~age_group_public, colors = "viridis", text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.8) |>
    layout(title = "Total Homelessness by Year and Age")
```

The above graph shows that the majority of homeless individuals who have received assistance are under the age of 18. The proportion of homeless people who have received assistance overall is higher among lower age groups. So we should pay attention to younger group to give them broader help. The overall trend of the homeless population receiving assistance is rising between 2021 and 2022, which is probably because of the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

##### Total Homelessness by Year and Ethnicity
```{r,message=FALSE}
# bar chart for "Total Homelessness by Year and ethnicity"
ethnicity_plot <- ethnicity_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location) |>
  group_by(calendar_year,ethnicity) |>
  summarise(total_homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness))

ethnicity_plot |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Year: ", calendar_year, "\nEthnicity: ", ethnicity)) |>
  plot_ly(x = ~calendar_year, y = ~total_homelessness, type = "bar", color = ~ethnicity, colors = "viridis", text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.8) |>
  layout(
    title = "Total Homelessness by Year and Ethnicity")
```

From the bar chart above we can see that people whose race are Hispanic/Latinx make up a large proportion of people receiving homeless response services, approximately 35%. However, based on the 2020 Census data, the Latino population in the United States totals 62.1 million, constituting 18.9% of the overall population. This demographic group stands as the second-largest ethnic or racial category in the country.So we need to focus on the vulnerable groups in ethnicity based on the problem of homelessness.

##### Total Homelessness by Year and Gender
```{r,message=FALSE}
# bar chart for "Total Homelessness by Year and gender"
gender_plot <- gender_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location) |>
  group_by(calendar_year,gender) |>
  summarise(total_homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness))

gender_plot  |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Year: ", calendar_year, "\nGender: ", gender)) |>
  plot_ly(x = ~calendar_year, y = ~total_homelessness, type = "bar", color = ~gender, colors = "viridis", text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.8) |>
  layout(
    title = "Total Homelessness by Year and Gender")
```

According to the bar chart by sex, we can know that the majority of people in need of assistance who are homeless are men, indicating that homelessness is a problem that affects more men than men and is rising annually for all genders from 2017 to 2022. The trend is downward and more controlled in 2023.

##### Total Homelessness by Year and Race
```{r,message=FALSE}
# line plot for "Total Homelessness by Year and race"
race_plot <- race_clean |>
  dplyr::select(-location) |>
  group_by(calendar_year,race) |>
  summarise(total_homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness))

race_plot  |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Year: ", calendar_year, "\nRace: ", race)) |>
  plot_ly(x = ~calendar_year, y = ~total_homelessness,  type = "scatter", mode = "line", color = ~race, colors = "viridis", text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.8) |>
  layout(
    title = "Total Homelessness by Year and Race" ,
    legend = list(
      x = 1,
      y = 0.5, 
      traceorder = "normal",
      bgcolor = "white", 
      bordercolor = "white",
      borderwidth = 0.5
    ))

# pie chart for "Percentage of Total Homeless by Race"
race_clean |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(total_homelessness = sum(experiencing_homelessness)) |>
  mutate(percentage = total_homelessness / sum(total_homelessness)) |>
  plot_ly(labels = ~race, values = ~percentage, type = "pie", hole = 0.4) |>
   layout(title = "Percentage of Total Homeless by Race")
```

Based on the percentage of total homeless by race, we can see that white people accounted for the largest percentage of homeless people receiving help at 55.1%, followed by Black, African American or African, the next largest group at 29.3%. This suggests that there is a relationship between race and Number of people receiving homelessness services, and that there is a need to focus on these two groups of people.

#### Kruskal-Wallis test
Next, we employ hypothesis testing as a method to more accurately assess the significance of relationships between variables. Through hypothesis testing, we aim to rigorously determine whether observed associations or differences between variables are statistically significant, providing a robust means to infer the presence of genuine relationships in our data.

When data does not meet the assumption of normality and involves multiple groups, we can consider using a non-parametric method for analysis, such as the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test used to compare differences among three or more groups, and it is less restrictive in terms of assumptions about the distribution of the data.

$H_0$: the distribution of Y is the same across all groups.\
$H_1$: At least one group has a different distribution.

If the test result is significant, it indicates that at least one group's median is different. However, it does not specify which groups are significantly different from each other. In such cases, you might need to perform multiple comparisons or follow-up pairwise tests to identify specific group differences.

```{r}
# 'data' with 'Y' (continuous) and 'Group' (categorical)
kruskal.test(experiencing_homelessness ~ age_group_public, data = age_clean)
kruskal.test(experiencing_homelessness ~ gender, data = gender_clean)
kruskal.test(experiencing_homelessness ~ ethnicity, data = ethnicity_clean)
kruskal.test(experiencing_homelessness ~ race, data = race_clean)
```
* statistic: The test statistic (H).\
* parameter: The degrees of freedom (df) associated with the test.\
* p.value: The p-value of the test.

If the p-value is less than chosen significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.

According to the results, the p-value of experiencing_homelessness by gender is greater than 0.05, which means the distribution of number of experiencing homelessness is the same across gender groups. However, all other tests' p-value is smaller than 0.01, which means at least one group has a different distribution in the whole age groups, ethnicity groups and race groups.

### Part2: datasets "Hospital Encounters for Homeless Patients"

#### Description of datasets

While this dataset is rich in hospital encounter information, it seems to differ from the 'demo' datasets described earlier. The 'demo' datasets focus on broader statistics of people receiving homeless response services across various dimensions such as age, race, ethnicity, and gender, and are sourced from the Homelessness Data Integration System (HDIS) which compiles data from California's Continuums of Care. In contrast, the provided dataset is more focused on hospital encounters of homeless individuals, offering a detailed view of healthcare utilization among this population.

-   Important Variables:

`2019-2020-homeless-ip-and-ed-by-facility` contains 17 variables, some of which are listed below:

`Licensed Bed Size`: the hospital's number of licensed beds.                        
`Homeless Indicator`: indicates if the data is for Homeless or Non-Homeless encounters.  
`Demographic Category`: Age, Race, Sex, or (Expected) Payer.       
`Encounters`: Count of inpatient hospitalizations (i.e., discharges) or emergency department visits.         
`Total Hospital Encounters`: Total inpatient hospitalizations or emergency department visits per hospital.     
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
homeless_ip<-read.csv("2019-2020-homeless-ip-and-ed-by-facility.csv")
homeless_data<-homeless_ip %>% 
  filter(HomelessIndicator == "Homeless")
```

#### Summary

Again, To begin with the analysis process, we summarized the counts of Californian homeless people receiving appropriate health services from 2019 to 2020 of the `2019-2020-homeless-ip-and-ed-by-facility.csv` dataset.

-   Important Variables:

`EncounterType`: whether receiving ED Visits or Inpatient Hospitalizations.
`FacilityName` :name of hospitals and systems the hospitals belong to.
`Ownership`: type of ownership that hospitals belong to.

`Urban_Rural`: whether hospitals locate in urban or rural areas.

`LicensedBedSize`: size of licensed beds per hospital.

`PrimaryCareShortageArea`: whether hospitals locate in area with limited primary care.

`MentalHealthShortageArea`: whether hospitals locate in area with limited mental health care.

```{r}
homeless_data_for_summary =
  homeless_data |>
  filter(HomelessIndicator == "Homeless") |>
  dplyr::select(EncounterType, FacilityName, System, Ownership, Urban_Rural, LicensedBedSize, PrimaryCareShortageArea, MentalHealthShortageArea, Encounters)

homeless_data_for_summary |>
  group_by(FacilityName) |>
  summarize(Homelessness = sum(Encounters)) |>
  mutate(Percent = (Homelessness / sum(Homelessness)) * 100)

```




#### Data Visualization

##### Homeless Encounters by Payer

```{r}
payer_data <- homeless_data %>% 
  filter(Demographic == "Payer")
payer_plot <- plot_ly(payer_data, x = ~DemographicValue, y = ~Encounters, 
                      type = 'bar', color = ~DemographicValue, 
                      colors = 'viridis') %>%
  layout(title = "Homeless Encounters by Payer Group",
         xaxis = list(title = "Payer Group", tickangle = 45),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Homeless Encounters"),
         barmode = 'group',
         bargap = 0.01)
payer_plot
```

This analysis provides a breakdown of homeless encounters by different demographic facets and indicates which groups have higher or lower counts of encounters. It suggests that middle-aged individuals, those covered by Medi-Cal, white individuals, and males have higher numbers of homeless encounters. These findings could point towards specific demographic groups that may require more focused services and interventions. 

##### Homeless Encounters by Bed Size
```{r}
plot2 <- plot_ly(homeless_data, x = ~LicensedBedSize, y = ~Encounters, 
                 type = 'bar', color = ~LicensedBedSize, 
                 colors = 'viridis') %>%
  layout(title = "Homeless Encounters by Bed Size",
         xaxis = list(title = "Licensed Bed Size", tickangle = 45),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Homeless Encounters"))
plot2
```

Among the variable Bed Size, the category of 400+ Licensed Bed Size shows a high number of encounters of homelessness as compared to other groups, indicating that larger hospitals may have a higher number of such encounters. This could be due to a larger capacity to serve more patients or a higher likelihood of being located in urban areas where homelessness rates may be higher. The second leading category is the 100-199 Licensed Bed Size which was relatively high, because hospitals with 100-199 beds might be specialized in services that are more frequently utilized by the homeless population, such as mental health or substance abuse treatment and these medium-sized hospitals could be strategically located in areas where the homeless population is higher. 

##### Homeless Encounters by Area
```{r}
plot3 <- plot_ly(homeless_data, x = ~Urban_Rural, y = ~Encounters, 
                 type = 'bar', color = ~Urban_Rural, 
                 colors = 'viridis') %>%
  layout(title = "Homeless Encounters in Urban vs. Rural Areas",
         xaxis = list(title = "Urban/Rural"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Homeless Encounters"))

plot3
```

This plot help us gain the understanding of the relationship between the number of homelessness encounters and rural/ urban settlement. It is evident that in urban areas there are many people who tend to be homeless due to various reasons such as poverty. Urban hospitals are often larger and have more comprehensive services, which might also contribute to the higher number of encounters. On the other hand, in rural areas less people tend to be homeless since life there is cheap and easily affordable. The more the population in a certain place the higher the chances of homelessness encounters.

##### Homeless Encounters by Ownership Type
```{r}
plot4 <- plot_ly(homeless_data, x = ~Ownership, y = ~Percent, 
                 type = 'bar', color = ~Ownership, 
                 colors = 'viridis') %>%
  layout(title = "Number of Homeless Encounters by Ownership Type",
         xaxis = list(title = "Ownership"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Homeless Encounters"))
plot4
```

When comparing the number of homeless encounters by ownership the non-profit category showed the highest number in homeless encounters. Non-Profit hospitals may have more encounters with homeless individuals possibly due to their mission-driven approach, which may include providing care to underserved populations. Investor-owned hospitals, while having a higher number of encounters than government hospitals, may still be less than Non-Profit hospitals, potentially due to different operational goals and priorities. Government-owned hospitals having the lowest number could be a result of factors such as location, size, the scope of services offered, or specific governmental policies and funding for homeless services.

**Description**

* **EncounterType Model**: The increase in the number of encounters for each additional emergency department visit. It is highly significant (p < 0.0001), suggesting a strong relationship between emergency department visits and the number of encounters.
* **Ownership Model**: The differences in the number of encounters for government-owned and investor-owned facilities compared to the Non-Profit facilities. Both coefficients are significant (p < 0.0001), indicating that ownership type is an important predictor of encounters. 
* **Urban_Rural Model**: The difference in the number of encounters between Rural/Frontier and Urban facilities. The negative coefficient suggests that Rural/Frontier facilities have fewer encounters than urban ones, and this is highly significant (p < 0.0001).
* **LicensedBedSize Model**: Coefficients (L, Q, C, ^4) represent the linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic terms in a polynomial regression model for ordered bed sizes. The 'L' term has a highly significant positive coefficient, indicating an initial increase in encounters with bed size. However, the lack of significance in the cubic ('C') terms, and the non-significant quadratic ('Q') and quartic term ('^4'), suggests that the relationship might not be strongly non-linear or that there is insufficient data to detect higher-order non-linearities.
* **Payer Model**: The differences in the number of encounters for Medicare payers, private coverage payers, uninsured payers, and other payers compared to Medi-Cal payers. All coefficients are significant (p < 0.0001), indicating that payer type is an important predictor of encounters. 
* **PrimaryCareShortageArea Model**: The differences in the number of encounters between primary care shortage areas and the areas without primary care shortage. The negative coefficient suggests that primary care shortage area have fewer encounters , and this is highly significant (p = 0.0018).
* **MentalHealthShortageArea Model**: The differences in the number of encounters between mental health shortage areas and the areas without mental health shortage. The negative coefficient suggests that mental health shortage have fewer encounters , and this is highly significant (p < 0.0001).


### Correlation Matrix
Since `ordered_LicensedBedSize` is ordinal data, we use Spearman correlation coefficients when constructing correlation matrix.
```{r,message=FALSE}
dat1 <- dat %>%
  mutate(ordered_LicensedBedSize = as.numeric(ordered_LicensedBedSize)) %>%
  dplyr::select(Encounters,ed_visit, government, investor, rural, ordered_LicensedBedSize, Medicare,Other_Payer,Private_Coverage,Uninsured,PrimaryCareShortageArea,MentalHealthShortageArea)

correlation_matrix <- cor(dat1, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")

# Visualize
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color", addCoef.col = "black", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, insig = "blank" , number.cex = 0.7, diag = FALSE)
```

**Description**

* the variable `rural` seems to have a moderately positive correlation with `PrimaryCareShortageArea` (0.5), suggesting that rural areas are more likely to be primary care shortage area.
* `rural` has a strong negative correlation with `ordered_LicensedBedSize` (-0.45), implying that rural facilities are likely to have fewer licensed beds.
* Correlation between all variables are below 70%, indicating that it is less likely that collinearity will pose a problem for the regression model.

### Yeo-Johnson transformation
First check `Encounters`
```{r}
sum_Encounters <- summary(dat$Encounters)
sum_Encounters_df <- as.data.frame(t(sum_Encounters))
```
| Min | 1st Qu. | Median | Mean | 3rd Qu. | Max |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|`r round(sum_Encounters_df$Freq[1])`| `r round(sum_Encounters_df$Freq[2])` | `r round(sum_Encounters_df$Freq[3])`| `r round(sum_Encounters_df$Freq[4])`| `r round(sum_Encounters_df$Freq[5])`|`r format(sum_Encounters_df$Freq[6], scientific = FALSE)`|

We observe that `Encounters` is non-negative.

Since `Encounters` can be 0, use Yeo-Johnson transformation$^8$ instead of Box-Cox transformation. Apply the following transformation for $y\ge 0$:
$$\psi(y,\lambda)=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{(y+1)^\lambda-1}{\lambda}, \quad &\lambda\neq 0\\
&\log(y+1), \quad &\lambda = 0
\end{aligned}
\right.$$
As with the Box-Cox transformation, the value of $\lambda$ is chosen via maximum likelihood estimation.

```{r,fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6,out.width= "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
# Shift the response variable to ensure all values are positive
shift_constant <- abs(min(dat$Encounters)) + 1  # Ensure the minimum value is at least 1
dat$Encounters_shifted <- dat$Encounters + shift_constant

# Fit the model with the shifted response variable
fit2_shifted <- lm(Encounters_shifted ~ ed_visit + government+investor + rural + ordered_LicensedBedSize +  Medicare+Other_Payer+Private_Coverage+Uninsured+PrimaryCareShortageArea+MentalHealthShortageArea, data = dat)

# Apply Box-Cox transformation on the shifted response variable
bc_shifted <- MASS::boxcox(fit2_shifted, lambda = seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1))
```

Yeo-Johnson method applies a transformation by raising `Encounters_shifted` to different power, as we can see above, $\lambda$ is close to 0, so we need to do natural logarithm transformation, turn `Encounters_shifted` into ln(`Encounters_shifted`).


### Multivariable Regression Model

```{r}
dat = dat %>%
  mutate(ln_Encounters = log(Encounters_shifted, base = exp(1)))
model = round_df(broom::tidy(lm(ln_Encounters ~ ed_visit + government+investor + rural + ordered_LicensedBedSize +  Medicare+Other_Payer+Private_Coverage+Uninsured+PrimaryCareShortageArea+MentalHealthShortageArea, data = dat)) ,4)
fit= lm(ln_Encounters ~ ed_visit + government+investor + rural + ordered_LicensedBedSize +  Medicare+Other_Payer+Private_Coverage+Uninsured+PrimaryCareShortageArea+MentalHealthShortageArea, data = dat)

knitr::kable(model)
```

**Description**

* **Coefficients**:
  * `ed_visit`: This predictor has a positive estimated coefficient of 1.4324, suggesting that there is a positive association between ed_visit and the response variable. Given the p-value is practically zero, this relationship is statistically significant.
  * `government`: The positive coefficient of 0.2086 for government implies a positive effect on the response variable, which is statistically significant based on the p-value (p=0.0024).
  * `investor`: This predictor has a negative coefficient of -0.1227, suggesting a negative association with the response variable, which is statistically significant based on the p-value (p=0.0307).
  * `rural`: The coefficient of -0.8228 indicates a strong negative relationship with the response variable, and the p-value confirms that this relationship is statistically significant.
  * `ordered_LicensedBedSize.L` (Linear term): The positive coefficient of 1.5354 for this term suggests a significant positive linear trend related to ordered_LicensedBedSize and the response variable.
  * `ordered_LicensedBedSize.Q` (Quadratic term): The negative coefficient of -0.4421 suggests that the relationship between ordered_LicensedBedSize and the response variable has a significant quadratic component, indicating a curved relationship.
  * `ordered_LicensedBedSize.C` (Cubic term): The cubic term has a positive coefficient of 0.2738 and a statistically significant p-value, indicating a cubic relationship is present.
  * `ordered_LicensedBedSize^4`: The fourth-degree polynomial term is not statistically significant (p-value=0.2577) and has a small estimated effect (0.0633), suggesting that it may not be a useful predictor in the model.
  * `Medicare`, `Other_Payer`, `Private_Coverage`, `Uninsured`: All payer types show a negative association with the number of encounters compared to Medi-Cal, with very strong statistical significance.
  * `PrimaryCareShortageArea`: Being in a primary care shortage area is negatively associated with the number of encounters, which is statistically significant.
  * `MentalHealthShortageArea`: Being in a mental health shortage area is positively associated with the number of encounters, which is statistically significant.
* Model Fit: The Multiple R-squared value of 0.5897 suggests that approximately 58.97% of the variability in Encounters is explained by the model.

### Model Diagnostics
```{r, fig.align= "center",fig.width = 9,fig.height = 9,out.width = "80%"}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(fit)
```

**Description**

The quartet of plots above demonstrates consistent variance of residuals across different fitted values, indicating homoscedasticity. The spread of residuals remains stable across the range of predictions, and their mean hovers around zero, indicating no systematic bias. Although there are minor fluctuations around the zero line, they are within an acceptable range, suggesting that the residuals are well-behaved. Additionally, the distribution of residuals appears to be normal, with no single observation exerting undue influence on the model. These observations collectively suggest that the key assumptions required for a valid linear regression model have been met.

## Regression Analysis 2

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(MASS)
```

### Import and Tidy Datasets

First, we import data and filter homeless people and only focus on the Demographic "Payer". Then we change several variables into factors and tidy the data.
Explanation for factor variables:\
LicensedBedSize: 1 = "1-99", 2 = "100-199", 3 = "200-299", 4 = "300-399", 5 = "400+"\
Ownership: 1 = "Investor", 2 = "Non-Profit", 3 = "Government"\
EncounterType:1 = "ED Visits", 0 = "Inpatient Hospitalizations"\
Urban_Rural: 1 = "Rural/Frontier", 0 = "Urban"\
Teaching: 1 = "Teaching", 0 = "Non-Teaching"\
PrimaryCareShortageArea: 1 = "Yes", 0 = "No"\
MentalHealthShortageArea: 1 = "Yes", 0 = "No"\
Payer: 1 = "Medi-Cal", 2 = "Medicare", 3 = "Other Payer", 4 = "Private Coverage", 5 = "Uninsured"

```{r, message=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("2019-2020-homeless-ip-and-ed-by-facility.csv") |>
   filter(HomelessIndicator == "Homeless" & Demographic == "Payer")

dat_clean <- dat |> 
  dplyr::select(HomelessIndicator,Ownership, Urban_Rural, Teaching, EncounterType, LicensedBedSize, PrimaryCareShortageArea,
                MentalHealthShortageArea, DemographicValue, Encounters) |>
  mutate(LicensedBedSize = match(LicensedBedSize,c("1-99","100-199","200-299","300-399","400+")),
         Ownership = match(Ownership, c("Investor", "Non-Profit", "Government")),
         EncounterType = ifelse(EncounterType == "ED Visits",1,0),
         Urban_Rural = ifelse(Urban_Rural == "Rural/Frontier",1,0),
         Teaching = ifelse(Teaching == "Teaching",1,0),
         PrimaryCareShortageArea = ifelse(PrimaryCareShortageArea == "Yes",1,0),
         MentalHealthShortageArea = ifelse(MentalHealthShortageArea == "Yes",1,0),
         Payer = match(DemographicValue, c("Medi-Cal", "Medicare", "Other Payer", "Private Coverage", "Uninsured"))
         )|>
           mutate(across(-Encounters, as.factor)) |> 
  dplyr::select(-DemographicValue,-HomelessIndicator) |>
           janitor::clean_names() 
         
summary(dat_clean)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Histogram
ggplot(dat_clean, aes(x = encounters)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of encounters", x = "encounters", y = "Frequency")

# Kernel Density Plot
ggplot(dat_clean, aes(x = log(encounters))) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Kernel Density Plot of log(encounters)", x = "log(encounters)", y = "Density")
```

Then we consider a model with the main effects of all variables and then use stepwise regression to select appropriate variables

### Method
#### Multiple Linear Regression:

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that extends the concept of simple linear regression to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. In MLR, the model is represented as:

MLR allows us to assess the individual and collective impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, providing valuable insights into the underlying relationships within the data. Assumptions, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals, are crucial for the validity of MLR results.

#### Stepwise Regression:

Stepwise Regression is a variable selection technique used in the context of multiple regression analysis. It systematically selects a subset of independent variables from a larger set, either by adding or removing variables based on specific criteria. There are two main types of stepwise regression: forward selection and backward elimination.

Backward Elimination:
Beginning with a model that includes all variables, backward elimination removes variables one at a time, excluding the variable that contributes the least to the model's explanatory power. The process continues until no more variables meet the exclusion criteria.

Stepwise Regression is employed to streamline the model by selecting the most influential variables while minimizing overfitting. 

```{r}
# full model
model_all <- lm(log1p(encounters) ~ ., data = dat_clean)

# stepwise regression
model_stepwise <- step(model_all, direction = "backward")

model_all |> 
  broom::tidy() |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

summary(model_stepwise)

model_stepwise |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

```
The stepwise regression model indicates that all variables that are important, the p-value of the model is < 2.2e-16, and Adjusted R-squared is 0.5912, which means approximately 59.12% of the variability in the log-transformed encounters can be explained by the predictor variables in your model.

* Licensed Bed Size:

The estimated coefficients (1.057, 1.534, 1.645, 1.971) indicate the change in log-transformed encounters associated with different licensed bed sizes. All coefficients are positive and statistically significant, suggesting that larger bed sizes are associated with higher log-transformed encounters.

* Ownership:

The estimated coefficients (0.101, 0.233) represent the change in log-transformed encounters associated with different ownership types.\
Interpreting each level:\
"Non-Profit" (2): +0.101 (not statistically significant)\
"Government" (3): +0.233 (statistically significant)\
"Investor" is the reference category.\
The "Government" ownership type is associated with a statistically significant increase in log-transformed encounters.

* Encounter Type:

The estimated coefficient (1.432) indicates the change in log-transformed encounters associated with "ED Visits" compared to "Inpatient Hospitalizations."\
"ED Visits" (1): +1.432\
"Inpatient Hospitalizations" (0) is the reference category.\
"ED Visits" are associated with a statistically significant increase in log-transformed encounters.

* Urban/Rural:

The estimated coefficient (-0.780) represents being in a "Rural/Frontier" area is associated with a statistically significant decrease in log-transformed encounters.

* Teaching:

The estimated coefficient (0.502) represents the change in log-transformed encounters associated with being in a "Teaching" environment compared to a "Non-Teaching" environment. Being in a "Teaching" environment is associated with a statistically significant increase in log-transformed encounters.

* Primary Care Shortage Area:

The estimated coefficient (-0.203) represents the change in log-transformed encounters associated with being in a "Primary Care Shortage Area" compared to a "Non-Shortage Area." Being in a "Primary Care Shortage Area" is associated with a statistically significant decrease in log-transformed encounters.

* Mental Health Shortage Area:

The estimated coefficient (0.250) represents the change in log-transformed encounters associated with being in a "Mental Health Shortage Area" compared to a "Non-Shortage Area." Being in a "Mental Health Shortage Area" is associated with a statistically significant increase in log-transformed encounters.

* Payer:

The estimated coefficients (-1.087, -3.410, -2.625, -2.005) represent the change in log-transformed encounters associated with different payer types compared to "Medi-Cal." All coefficients are negative and statistically significant, suggesting that compared to "Medi-Cal," other payer types are associated with a decrease in log-transformed encounters.

#### Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a common indicator used to detect multicollinearity in regression models. A higher VIF value indicates that the corresponding independent variable is more likely to be influenced by other independent variables. Typically, VIF values exceeding 10 or 20 are considered indicative of the presence of multicollinearity.

```{r}
library(car)
vif_values <- vif(model_stepwise)
print(vif_values)
# The result is no multicollinearity.
```
We show a plot of model residuals against fitted values.

```{r}
library(modelr)
dat_clean %>% 
    add_predictions(model_stepwise) %>% 
    add_residuals(model_stepwise) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
    geom_point()  + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    labs(title = "Model residuals against fitted values", 
       x = "Predicted values", 
       y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We observe a plot of model residuals against fitted values in regression analysis and notice that the slope is close to zero, it suggests that there is homoscedasticity in the residuals. Homoscedasticity means that the variability of the residuals (or errors) is approximately constant across all levels of the independent variable(s) or across the range of predicted values, which is a desirable assumption in regression analysis. 

#### Cross validation

In cross-validation, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is a measure of the average magnitude of prediction errors made by a model. A lower RMSE indicates that the model has better predictive accuracy, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the true values.
```{r}
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(dat_clean, 100)

cv_df <- cv_df |>
  mutate(train = map(train, as_tibble),
         test = map(test, as_tibble)) |>
 mutate(
    stepwise_mod  = map(train, ~model_stepwise)) |> 
  mutate(
    rmse_stepwise = map2_dbl(stepwise_mod, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)))

cv_df |>
  dplyr::select(starts_with("rmse")) |>
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") |> 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin() +
  theme_minimal()

```
From the violin plot, we can know that the stepwise regression model has relative low rmse, approximately 1.43, which means the model has better predictive accuracy

## Discussion

### EDA & Shiny App

* Based on the EDA of datasets, males and individuals under 18 years old constitute a higher percentage within the population receiving assistance from Continuums of Care (CoC). The proportion of Hispanic individuals among those who received assistance from Continuums of Care (CoC) is higher than the percentage of Hispanics in the general population. This suggests a greater likelihood for the Hispanic population to experience homelessness and be registered as homeless in CoC. Additionally, among races other than Hispanic, Whites represent a higher percentage of registered homelessness encounters at CoC.

* From the visualization from the Shiny dashboard, it is observed that Los Angeles, followed by other cities including San Diego and San Francisco, contains a high proportion of homeless people receiving various hospitalsâ€™ services. This shows the trend that large cities in California usually carry much of the medical resources and accommodate the largest proportion of homelessness. 

Our findings can inform policymaking aimed at addressing the needs of the more vulnerable populations experiencing homelessness. For instance, given the higher prevalence of homelessness among the younger demographic, targeted strategies could include implementing programs to support at-risk youth, creating shelters tailored to their specific needs for a safe and supportive environment, and developing educational and vocational training initiatives to enhance the skills and employability of young individuals experiencing homelessness.

The comparison between investor-owned hospitals, receiving fewer homeless patient visits than non-profit hospitals, suggests the need for targeted interventions. This insight informs resource distribution policies among hospitals. For instance, recognizing the higher likelihood of homeless patients visiting urban hospitals, additional resources, funding, and support could be allocated to enhance their capacity for homeless patient care. Acknowledging the higher number of homeless patient visits in governmental hospitals, policies providing financial incentives or additional resources can support their role in serving homeless populations. Since there may be fewer homeless encounters, possibly due to higher expenses, strategies such as introducing incentives for investor-owned hospitals to actively engage in initiatives addressing homelessness, including tax benefits, grants, or partnerships with non-profit organizations, could be explored.


### Statistical Anaylsis

* Based on the statistical anaylsis of first datasets, we employ Kruskal-Wallis test to compare differences among groups. The results show that the distribution of number of experiencing homelessness is the same across gender groups, while at least one group has a different distribution in the whole age groups, ethnicity groups and race groups, which means there is a statistically significant correlation observed between the variables `age`, `race`, and `ethnicity` with `experiencing homelessness`.

### Regression Analysis

* Based on the results of regression analysis 1, univariate analyses underscored the significant impact of emergency department visits, while ownership type, particularly government-owned facilities, demonstrated an increase in encounters, and rural locations exhibited fewer encounters compared to urban areas. The multivariable regression model unveiled a strong positive correlation between licensed bed numbers and encounter rates. Notably, Medicare, private coverage, and uninsured statuses correlated with fewer encounters, while primary care shortage areas negatively influenced encounter rates. Conversely, mental health shortage areas positively impacted encounters, suggesting increased service demand. Model diagnostics affirmed the reliability of predictions, confirming homoscedasticity of residuals.

* Based on the results of regression analysis 2, stepwise regression model, incorporating various hospital and encounter-related factors, demonstrated strong statistical significance (p-value < 2.2e-16) and a moderate explanatory power with an adjusted R-squared of approximately 59.12%. In terms of cross validation, the rmse is relative low, approximately 1.43. The regression model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing healthcare utilization. Larger bed sizes, government ownership, ED visits, teaching environments, and certain payer types are associated with increased healthcare encounters, while rural areas, primary care shortage areas, and specific payer types are associated with decreased encounters. These findings can inform healthcare resource allocation, policy decisions, and strategies to address healthcare disparities in different regions and settings.

## Limitations and Expectations

Despite the valuable insights gained, our analysis has limitations. The datasets, while comprehensive, may not capture all nuances of homelessness and healthcare utilization. The observational nature of the data limits causal inferences. Additionally, regional variations may influence results. Expectations for this project include informing targeted interventions, resource allocation strategies, and policy decisions. Ongoing refinement and expansion of datasets can enhance the robustness of future analyses, contributing to more effective strategies in addressing homelessness and healthcare disparities.
